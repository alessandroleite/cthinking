# Recursion

* Remember, recursion is a problem-solving technique in which tasks are completed by reducing them into repeated, smaller tasks of the same form.
* It comprises two main components: the base and the recursive cases

## Fractals

* A fractal is any repeated, graphical pattern.
* It is composed of repeated instances of the same shape or pattern, arranged in a structured way.

## Drawing Fractals with the Turtle Graphics

* The `turtle` module provides some basic commands for drawing lines on the screen in an animated way.
* You can think it as a turtle holding a pen.
* The `turtle` has three attributes: a `location`, an `orientation`, and a `pen`.
* The `pen` has attributes `color`, `width`, and `state`.
* For example, the following code asks the turtle to draw a line 150 pixels long.

```python
import turtle

pen = turtle.Turtle()
pen.forward(150)
```

* You can also ask it to move forward, backward, and turn left and right, as well as to draw a circle:

```python
import turtle

pen = turtle.Turtle()

for i in range(360):
    pen.forward(1)
    pen.right(1)  
```

* All functions available as part of the turtle library are available at [https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html).

* You can draw different geometric figures.
* For instance, you can instruct the turtle to draw the [Koch snowflake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koch_snowflake) following a recursive strategy.

<!-- ![Koch snowflake](/img/koch-curve-levels.png) -->

* The **base** is a straight line
* The procedures to draw the first level include:
    - Draw a line 1/3 the total length
    - Rotate 60 degrees to the left
    - Draw another line 1/3 the total length
    - Rotate 120 degrees to the right
    - Draw a third line 1/3 the total length
    - Rotate 60 degrees to the left
    - Draw a fourth and final line 1/3 the total length
* For the next level, you simply take one of the _lines_ and draw a shrunken copy of the described procedure

```python
import turtle

def koch(t, order, size):
    if order == 0:
        t.forward(size)
    else:
        koch(t, order-1, size/3)
        t.left(60)
        koch(t, order-1, size/3)
        t.right(120)
        koch(t, order-1, size/3)
        t.left(60)
        koch(t, order-1, size/3)

def main():
    pen = turtle.Turtle(shape="turtle")
    screen = turtle.Screen()
    screen.title('Turtle Koch Curve')

    pen.color("green")
    pen.shapesize(1)    
    pen.penup()
    pen.speed('fastest')
    pen.backward(150)
    pen.pendown()

    koch(pen, 3, 300)

    screen.exitonclick()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()

```
