# Searching and Sorting

The Boolean operator **in** tests the membership in a **sequence**.

```python
cheeses = ["Cheddar", "Edam", "Gouda", "Feta"]
print("Edam" in cheeses)
print("Manouri" in cheeses)
```

Since _Edam_ is a member of the list _cheeses_, the **in** operator returns **True**. It returns **False** for _Manouri_, since it is not a member of the list _cheeses_.

We can combine **not** with **in** to test whether an element is not a member of the list

```python
print("Manouri" not in cheeses)
```

In this case, the output is **True**.

The method **sort** arranges the elements of the list in ascending order

```python
cheeses.sort()
```

* It changes the list in-place. 
* You can use the built-in function **sorted** to create a sorted version of a given list

```python
b_sorted = sorted(b)
```

<p>3. A standard deck of playing cards contains 52 cards. Each card has one of four suits along with a value. The suits are normally spades, hearts, diamonds and clubs while the values are 2 through 10, Jack, Queen, King and Ace. Each playing card can be represented using two characters. The first character is the value of the card, with the values 2 through 9 being represented directly. The characters T, J, Q, K, and A are used to represent the values 10, Jack, Queen, King and Ace respectively. The second character is used to represent the suit of the card. It is normally a lowercase letter: s for spades, h for hearts, d for diamonds, and c for clubs. The following table provides several examples of cards and their two-character representations.</p>

</div>

| Card         | Abbreviation |
|--------------|-----------|
| Jack of spades | Js      |
| Two of clubs | 2c |
| Ten of diamonds | Td |
| Ace of hearts | Ah |
| Nine of spades | 9s |

<div>
<p>Begin by writing a function named _create_deck_. It uses loops to create a complete deck of cards by storing the two-character abbreviations for all 52 cards into a list. Return the list of cards as the function's result. The function should not require any parameters. Write a second function named _shuffle_ that randomizes the order of the cards in a list. One technique that can be used to shuffle the cards is to visit each element in the list and swap it with another random element in the list. <strong>You must write your own loop for shuffling the cards</strong>, and you cannot make use of Python's built-in <em>shuffle</em> function. Use these functions to create a program that displays a deck of cards before and after it has been shuffled.</p>

<p style="background-color:lightgray">A good shuffling algorithm is unbiased, meaning that every different arrangement of the elements is equally probable when the algorithm completes. While the approach described previously suggested visiting each element in sequence and swapping it with an element at a random index, such an algorithm is biased. In particular, elements that appear later in the original list are more likely to end up later in the shuffled list. Counterintuitively, an unbiased shuffle can be achieved by visiting each element in sequence and swapping it to a random index between the position of the current element and the end of the list instead of randomly selecting any index.</p>
