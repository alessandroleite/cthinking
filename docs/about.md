## Course description

Computation plays an essential role in today's world. Understanding computation lies at the heart of many scientific and social developments. This course will discuss computation's power and limitations, including what is computable and how efficient a solution is. Computational thinking skill set go beyond programming a computer, as it can be applied to any field that requires problem-solving abilities â€” it is all about thinking about abstractions. It has become a fundamental skill for everyone and a tool for understanding the technology that pervades our social world. Likewise, computational thinking increases our awareness of how everyday digital tools work, grounds our cyber ethics, and improves our resilience against various threats, such as algorithm-driven attempts to guide our behavior, personally tailored fake news, viral powers of social media, and massive data-intensive analysis of our movements. It is a powerful but not universal approach to problem-solving, as the ability to solve a problem depends on understanding the context in which the problem exists. For instance, one must understand fluid dynamics to build a simulation of aircraft in flight, or one must understand the genome's biology and the data collection methods to develop a program to search genome databases.
